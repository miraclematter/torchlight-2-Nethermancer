In Progress
	Jagged Bones -> Nethermorphosis rework
		needs altered Tendril skills, starting with Legion's Grasp -> Devouring Tendril
		needs particle effects for the aura unit theme, for when it ends, and for altered skills
	Festering Aura more readable particle effect


---NOW---

Void Helix: rekajigger charging mechanic (IMPORTANT)
	low power - slightly weaker and has no extra freeze chance
	high power - far stronger and guaranteed to freeze, with a scaling duration
	other - maybe rework into a hold-and-release charge shot instead of a stacking passive charge shot
	?change to weapon DPS instead of flat magic damage?

Nether Phase: REQUIRE missing charge, causing the spell to fail if there is not enough room for the necessary charge to be generated
	effectively locks the cooldown at 3 seconds when at high charge
	on second thought, let it be. let people be Nightstalker. mana should be the limiting factor here

rearrange Eldritch tree to its final shape

---

Miasma: should apply current level of Nethertoxin (IMPORTANT)

Carrion Call: separate out the corpse explosion into its own skill (in the Flesh tree), reduce mana cost in return

Plague Pustule: if at all possible, should be a valid target for Carrion Call and Corpse Explosion
	if this isn't possible, buff Animus Blast so it can be used to wear down enemies sooner
	unlocks at level 28 (14 if usable for Carrion Call)

Animus Blast: maybe buff early damage so that it's usable to get the netherling ball rolling earlier in the game
	unlocks at level 14 (28 if Carrion Call works on Plague Pustules)

come up with control skill to replace Netherguard (IMPORTANT)
	maybe a poisonous, sticky ichor trail to replicate the nethermancer's trail
	or a charm
	unlocks at level 35

Festering Aura: replace various particle effects with an easy-to-read "counter" sort of thing, League of Legends style (IMPORTANT)
	should make it easier to detect good Expunge targets

rearrange Plague tree to its final shape

Tentacle Lash: rework into Flaying Tendril (incorporates aspects of Tentacle Lash, Impale, and Flay) (IMPORTANT)
	Flaying Tendril - quickly strikes enemies in a medium-range narrow cone, tipping an enemy with this attack shatters their shield
	Nethermorphosis - hits twice in two slightly overlapping cones and always shatters shields

Nether Assault: rename to Grappling Tendril
	Grappling Tendril - root a target and grapple yourself to it, knocking away and slowing other foes around them
	Nethermorphosis - widens hitbox and adds stun chance

Jagged Bones: rework into Nethermorphosis (IMPORTANT) (KEYSTONE SKILL HERE LOTS OF SHIT TO DO MANY GOAL SO WORK)
	Transform into a tentacled horror, modifying all of your Tendril skills and automatically counterattacking foes that strike you.
	requires full charge to cast, drains X% charge per second, and goes on cooldown once charge runs out
	charge benefits are locked at their maximum values while this skill is in effect
	increases physical size, sprouts tentacles from character's back, and adds a black/pink nether aura
	unlocks at level 42

Impale: replace with corpse explosion taken from carrion call
	damage based on corpse's maximum HP, dealt as half physical burst in small radius, half poison DoT in larger radius
	Nethermorphosis - not affected
	mainly scales by radius, which starts out very small, actual damage increases very little or not at all
	unlocks at level 35

Wall of Flesh: renamed to Thrashing Tendrils
	unlocks at level 28

Legion's Grasp: rework into Devouring Tendril (filling a niche kind of like Raze as an extreme single-target option) (IMPORTANT)
	Devouring Tendril - latch onto a single target and crush the life out of them, conveys all on-hits (single target Legion's Grasp)
	Nethermorphosis - hits additional targets around you
	costs mana instead of charge
	unlocks at level 21

come up with passive to replace Flay (maybe some kind of bonus to maces and/or claws) (IMPORTANT)
	+cleaving and +execute chance (works with most weapons, but particularly benefits dual swords/axes/maces, too boring)
	each hit strips armor (too much like Shred Armor, effective but boring)
	sprout tentacles from your back that grant +reflect and +dodge (awesome concept, but may be overkill on defensive stuff)
	chance when struck to summon the Flesh That Hates, a short-lived minion with massive lifesteal-to-master (not bad but selfish)
	executing rends enemies, causing all direct damage to siphon life (fairly simple change, adds a unique support-y twist)
