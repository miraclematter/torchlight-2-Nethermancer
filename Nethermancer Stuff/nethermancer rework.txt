Warp Shell: Blocks all damage from a single attack against you. Has a 10..3 second cooldown.

Regent's Blessing: The nether powers consume you entirely, transforming you into a hulking eldritch abomination. While in this form, you reflect damage to attacking foes and your Tendril skills are replaced with slower, more powerful versions. Requires full charge to cast, and gradually drains charge while active.
	Flaying Tendril - Strikes a second time in a wide arc.
	Grappling Tendril - Pulls target to you instead.
	Devouring Tendril - Grabs additional targets around you.
	Whipping Tendril - Rearranged into a ring around you.
