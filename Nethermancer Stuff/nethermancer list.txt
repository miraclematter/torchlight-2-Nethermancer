Nethermorphosis currently in an unreleasable state, and also kind of ugly


ELDRITCH - portal magic, pitch black voids filled with sparkling stars and swirling galaxies, ringed with a deep purple-blue glow

PLAGUE - decay and consumption, clouds of pinkish miasma dripping with black ichor, swarms of featureless gnashing mouths
two trees in one, first revolves around caring for a swarm of fragile minions, second revolves around spreading and detonating debuffs

unclean one
