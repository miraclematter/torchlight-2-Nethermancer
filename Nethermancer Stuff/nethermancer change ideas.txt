-I'm pretty happy with the Eldritch tree at this point, the only thing that's even on my radar anymore is Void Helix's charging mechanic. If it's just not fun enough it may get tweaked, nothing huge.

-I may replace the Netherguard with some other kind of pet. There's nothing actually [i]bad[/i] about them, I've just never been thrilled to have them and they aren't very plague-y. I'm thinking some kind of charm spell, so you can make your own nether-thralls. Or, maybe, just nothing at all. We already have three wildly different summons plus Animus Blast, Chilblains, and other skills for supporting them, I think summoners are plenty fun already.

-Still not completely happy with the Flesh tree. Here's a few ideas I've got written down, nothing is guaranteed at all yet, but thoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated. These are roughly in order of how badly I want them to happen.
1) Fusing Tentacle Lash, Impale, and Flay into a single skill, creating a quick mid-range lash that strips armor and shields. It would basically do what Flay and Impale do now, just refitted into more of a primary attack skill. Plus, whipping looks cooler than stabbing. Lash's slow would move somewhere else, like Nether Assault or the empty spot in the plague tree.
2) Bringing back Thrashing Tendrils, but fancied-up so that it sprouts actual physical tentacles from your character, which occasionally swat nearby enemies and deflect projectiles. It would replace Flay.
3) Replacing Nether Assault's panic effect with either the slow or charge bonus from Tentacle Lash. The panic would either move to a new skill or just disappear altogether.
4) Bringing back Atrophy as an active skill, filling the open slot left by Impale. This would either be the new home for Assault's panic (in which case the stolen stats would result in you hulking out, hitting harder but slower) or Lash's slow (in which case you would gain the stolen speed)
5) Adding a way to pull single enemies to you, possibly folded into Nether Assault as an all-around "grappling tentacle," or more likely as its own new skill to fill the empty spot left by Impale. Something like a pull/disable/lifesteal combo, or some other crazy-strong single-target skill along the lines of Raze.
